Echo Care

The goal of our project is to offer assistance to jeriatric nurses via Amazon Echo Dot to do the following:

-Wake up patients

-Remind patients to take medicine

-Support ability to contact nurse if needed

-Provide Accessible content to users, including weather data, time, and any reminders they may have set for the day

All of this is done through the use of an Amazon Echo (or Echo Dot) owned by a paitent. 

The nurse can access data through the website and create reminders for the paitent or update their medicinal scheduele.
